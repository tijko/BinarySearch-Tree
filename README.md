Trees
==================

#### Binary-Search
This is an implementation of a complete binary search tree. 

The 'complete' part of the this tree comes where each node will always have two
children, where one will either be a value and the other None or both will be 
None.

####Usage:

You can run the python version just the same as any .py file.  

The C version you can compile running `make` and run the executable `./bst`.

The perl version run as any other perl script.
