Binary-Search-Tree
==================

A sorted binary tree!

This is an implementation of a complete binary search tree. 

The 'complete' part of the this tree comes where each node will always have two
children, where one will either be a value and the other None or both will be 
None.

####Usage:

You can run the python version just the same as any .py file.  The C version you 
can compile with `gcc BST.c lib/BST_actions.c -o BST -Wall -g` and then run the 
executable `./BST`.  The perl version run as any other perl script.
